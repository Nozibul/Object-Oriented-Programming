# üåü Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) 

Welcome to the **OOP Repository**! This repository is designed to provide a comprehensive learning path and practical implementation of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts, specifically focusing on **Backend Development**. All examples and practices will use **Golang** to explore the full potential of OOP in modern software development.

---

## üöÄ What‚Äôs Inside?

This repository is divided into **3 main sections**:
1. **OOP Concepts**: Learn the theoretical foundation of OOP.
2. **Backend Development**: Apply OOP principles in real-world backend projects.
3. **Additional Resources & Practices**: Deep dive into advanced practices, design principles, and refactoring techniques to write quality code.

## üß† The Concept of OOP: What and Why?  

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that structures code around **objects** rather than functions. Objects encapsulate **data** (fields, properties) and **behavior** (methods) to solve complex problems in an intuitive and reusable way.

### Key Topics Covered:
1. **Class & Object**: Understanding what objects ARE and how they work.
2. **Object Members**:
   - **Data/Field/Property**: What an object HAS.
   - **Method**: What an object DOES.
3. **Object Initialization**:
   - Using **Constructors** for creating objects.
4. **Thinking in an Object-Oriented Way**:
   - How to structure code around real-world entities.
5. **Reference Type**: How objects interact and are referenced.
6. **Method Overloading** & **Constructor Overloading**.
7. **Delegation & Association Relationships**.
8. **Inheritance**:
   - Reusing and extending functionality.
   - **Method Overriding** and **Constructor Chaining**.
9. **Polymorphism**:
   - **Runtime Polymorphism** (Dynamic).
   - **Static Polymorphism** (Generics).
10. **Interface**:
    - Abstraction and defining contracts.

## üîë OOP Principles: SOLID & More

### Introduction to SOLID Principles:
1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: A class should have only one responsibility.
2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Classes should not depend on unused interfaces.
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.

### Additional Principles:
- **Tell, Don‚Äôt Ask**: Focus on objects doing their job rather than asking for data.
- **DRY (Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself)**: Avoid duplication in code.
- **The Law of Demeter**: Minimize object dependencies.
- **YAGNI (You Aren‚Äôt Gonna Need It)**: Only implement features when required.

## üõ†Ô∏è Good Practices for Quality Code  

### Code Smells:
Common coding issues that affect quality:
1. Long Method
2. Large Class
3. Primitive Obsession
4. Long Parameter List
5. Data Clumps
6. Refused Bequest
7. Switch Statements
8. Temporary Field
9. Comments
10. Duplicate Code
11. Dead Code
12. Lazy Class
13. Speculative Generality
14. Feature Envy
15. Inappropriate Name
16. Middle Man

### Refactoring Techniques:
How to improve your code:
1. **Extract Method**: Simplify large methods.
2. **Inline Method**: Replace redundant methods with their code.
3. **Extract Variable**: Improve code readability.
4. **Replace Temp with Query**.
5. **Replace Method with Method Object**.
6. **Substitute Algorithm**.
7. **Move Method** & **Move Field**.
8. **Extract Class** & **Inline Class**.
9. **Remove Middle Man**.
10. **Encapsulate Field** & **Collection**.
11. **Replace Type Code with Class/Subclasses/Strategy**.
12. **Replace Conditional with Polymorphism**.
13. **Introduce Null Object**.
14. **Replace Constructor with Factory Method**.
15. **Pull Up/Pull Down Fields and Methods**.
16. **Extract Superclass/Interface**.
17. **Replace Inheritance with Delegation**.

## üî• Why OOP for Backend Development?  

Object-Oriented Programming is incredibly powerful in backend development because it:
1. **Simplifies Code Management**: Encapsulation ensures modular code.
2. **Improves Scalability**: Polymorphism and inheritance help manage complex systems.
3. **Enhances Reusability**: Interfaces and relationships reduce code duplication.
4. **Promotes Clean Architecture**: With SOLID principles and refactoring techniques, OOP ensures maintainable and scalable codebases.

We‚Äôll be using **Golang** to demonstrate these concepts and build backend applications that are robust, scalable, and adhere to best practices.
